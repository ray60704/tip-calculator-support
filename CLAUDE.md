# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is a simple static website for the Happy Tip calculator app support page. It consists of two HTML files with inline CSS styling:

- `index.html` - Main support page with contact information and link to privacy policy
- `privacy-policy.html` - Privacy policy page

## Development Notes

### Structure
- Pure HTML/CSS static site - no JavaScript or build process
- All styles are inline within each HTML file
- No external dependencies or frameworks

### Deployment
This appears to be a simple static site that can be deployed directly to any web server or static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

### Key Information
- Contact email: kuanhao.su@gmail.com
- App name: Happy Tip (a tip calculator app)
- The privacy policy emphasizes that the app collects no personal data and operates entirely locally on the user's device
